# MobyMon

MobyMon is a Visual C++ program I wrote around 1997 which decoded data transmitted by Mobitex data networks. 
This program communicated with a hardware modem I designed (based around a 8751 microcontroller) and without that this program isn't usable. But it contains some good info on Mobitex data types which may be useful to someone.
